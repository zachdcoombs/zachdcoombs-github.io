								<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
								<p>I am a graduate of  Volunteer State Community College in Gallatin, TN with an AAS in Programming. I have experience in Python, C++, C#, ASP.net, JAVA, SQL, React, Javascript, Tailwind and others. You can check out some of my projects <a href="#work">here</a>.</p>
								<p>I have a passion for all things technology and programming, as reflected in my body of work so far. I enjoy learning what makes things work and have a deep interest in using existing tools in new and unique ways.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>

								<p>A collection of some of my projects throughout my time programming.</p>

								<a href="https://zachdcoombs.github.io/weather-app/"><span class="image main"><img src="images/weather-app.png" alt=""></span></a>
								<p>A React JS site that uses Openweathermap's free API to return the current conditions, hourly, and daily forecast to the user.
									Created with the Tailwind CSS framework, along with images from Unsplash, and Toastify for card alerts. 
								</p>

								<a href="https://zachdcoombs.github.io/library-app/"><span class="image main"><img src="images/library.PNG" alt=""></span></a>
								<p>A 90s themed library app that utilizes flex elements to store and display a running list of books in a reader's library.
									Primarily a project to show off some CSS animations, but also as a deeper understanding of Javascript of responsive design.
								</p>

								<a href="https://zachdcoombs.github.io/browser-synth/"><span class="image main"><img src="images/synth.png" alt=""></span></a>
								<p>An in-broswer synth that can be played using your keyboard on desktop, or simply tapped in landscape mode on mobile devices. A project
									built to challenge my knowledge of HTML/CSS as well as Javascript.
								</p>

								<a href="https://github.com/zachdcoombs/flappybirdneat"><span class="image main"><img src="images/flappybird.png" alt="" /></span></a>
								<p>A Pygame-built version of Flappy Bird that utilizes the NEAT algorithm to train birds to not hit pipes in the game.</p>

								<a href="https://github.com/zachdcoombs/indeedscraper"><span class="image main"><img src="images/scraper.png"/></span></a>
								<p>Utility that loads ten pages worth of job data for the user. Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and outputs to a CSV file.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/wifi.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A little utility that can show the wifi addresses and passwords for the device it runs on.
								</p>

								<a href="https://github.com/zachdcoombs/spaceinvaders"><span class="image main"><img src="images/spaceinvaders.png"/></span></a>
								<p>A Space Invaders-like game built using pygame. Built as an entry point to programming small games in python.

								<p>My name is Zach Coombs and I am an avid rock climber and adventurer with an insatiable appetite for all things technology and programming.
									Two of my core philosophies are to learn something new every day and to always seek adventure. 
								</p>

								<p>I'm a problem-solver with over 15 years of experience in service, sales and management roles. These positions taught me how to not only conduct business effectively, 
									but also soft skills such as time management and how to communicate with any member of an organization. As a manager I oversaw project completion, maintained 
									business standards and policies, coached results-driven behaviors, and optimized workflows to increase productivity. As an associate I strive to master the 
									assigned task and take immense pride in going above and beyond in my work.
								</p>

								<p>I was born in Newport News, Virginia to a couple of ex-New Englanders, one a Navy man and the other a bookkeeper. I grew up in nearby Hampton where I spent the first
									8 years of my life before moving to Middletown, Rhode Island--a mostly Navy community adjacent to it's much more famous neighbor, Newport, on Aquidneck Island. Most people
									know it as the place where families like the Vanderbilt's and Astor's had a summer home. It was around this time that I first got into computers and all they could do at the 
									time. Granted, this was in an era when Windows 98 was bleeding edge, but I would spend hours playing Solitaire, or begging my Mom to let me tie up the phone line so I 
									could check out some website on AOL. I thought it was so cool how I could interact with this thing and it could give me information back--this evolved into playing more
									serious game titles and started a fascination with how things we use on computers were made.
								</p>

								<p>My first interaction with programming came in Rhode Island when I was in Middle School: building a basic HTML webpage. I learned how to place pictures, make links to other pages
									I designed myself and so on. I'd spend all my free time at home trying to develop the coolest personal website for myself or for some topic I was interested in at the time, 
									probably skating or some other action sport. By the time we headed West for Bremerton, Washington--a small town along the Puget Sound, right across from Seattle, I had been 
									introduced to Diablo II. Not only was I hopelessly hooked on the game, but I learned through various resources and word of mouth in online lobbies that the game files could be
									changed to alter almost any parameter within the game. Before long I was duplicating items, creating impossibly good armor, making hacked characters that could use any skill from 
									any class (including the game's bosses!)--you name it, I changed it. That gave me my first insight into how programs actually worked under the hood.
								</p>

								<p>By the time I graduated from Dobyns-Bennett High School in Kingsport, TN I had dabbled in a variety of programming languages and headed off to Tennessee Technological University 
									to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering, having enjoyed a variety of AutoCAD related courses in high school. Soon after, I realized I was more interested in making the tools
									that people use to design their projects than actually using them myself, and I made the change to a Computer Science major to pursue my real passion: programming. I completed 
									6 total semesters under the Software Engineering program learning key concepts such as object oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms all while building projects. 
									Due to personal reasons I left the university to work full-time, where I got to put some of my newly acquired skills to work. In this time I developed projects that allowed for 
									easier scheduling while in a management role, and spent 5 years in another as a manager who oversaw operations, including IT-related troubleshooting. 
								</p>

								<p>In Fall 2019 I began pursuing my Associate's in Programming from Volunteer State Community College in Gallatin, TN while working full-time. Here I was taught more modern languages 
									like Python, Javascript, ASP .NET, jQuery, and more--while spending time starting to build projects I felt were good enough to save. This culminated in a final project that created 
									an inventory system and database for make-believe products. It's not pretty, and doesn't technically "do" anything besides move around some values, but I have several ideas on how to
									bring the concept to a more usable standard. Having graduated in May 2022, I am now seeking employment as an entry-level developer after moving on from my previous position as a 
									Store Manager. I felt that it was time for a stable career that could provide my family and I a more secure future.
